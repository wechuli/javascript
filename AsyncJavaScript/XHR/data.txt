And You as Well Must Die beloved dust
And all youe beauty stand you in no stead
This flawless vital hand, this perfect head
This body of flame and steel before the gust of death
Or under his autumnal frost shall be as any leaf, be no less dead
Than the first leaf that fell, this wonder fled

Altered estranged disintegrated, lost
Nor shall my love avail you in your hour
Insipite of all my love you will arise upon that day
And wander down the air, obscurely as the unnattended flower
It mattering not how beautiful you were
Or how beloved above all else that dies
