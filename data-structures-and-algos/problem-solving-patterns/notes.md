## Frequency Counter

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values. This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings.

## Multiple Pointers

Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towars the beginning , end or middle based on a certain condition. Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well
