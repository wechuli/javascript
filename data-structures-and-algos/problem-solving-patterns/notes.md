## Frequency Counter

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values. This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings.

## Multiple Pointers

Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towars the beginning , end or middle based on a certain condition. Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

## Sliding Window Pattern

This pattern involves creating a **window** which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes(and a new window is created). Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

## Divide and Conquer

This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data. This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity.
