## Abstract Data Types
- In computer science, an abstract data type(ADT) is a mathematical model for data types, where a data type is defined by its behavior(semantics) from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on the data of this type, and the behavior of these operations

- Formally, an ADT may be defined as a 'class of objects whose logical behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations'
