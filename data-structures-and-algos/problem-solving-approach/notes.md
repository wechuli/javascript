## Algorithm

An algortihm is simply a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task. Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm.

It's the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer.

### How to improve in solving Algorithmic Problems

- Devise a plan for solving problems
- Master common problem solving patterns

## Problem Solving Approach
 - Understand the Problem
 - Explore concrete examples
 - Break It down
 - Solve/Simplify
 - Loom Back and Refactor

### Understand the Problem

Ask yourself this question:
- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem
- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem
