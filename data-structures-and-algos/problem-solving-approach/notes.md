## Algorithm

An algortihm is simply a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task. Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm.

It's the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer.

### How to improve in solving Algorithmic Problems

- Devise a plan for solving problems
- Master common problem solving patterns

## Problem Solving Approach

- Understand the Problem
- Explore concrete examples
- Break It down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look Back and Refactor

### Understand the Problem

Ask yourself this question:

- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem
- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem

### Explore concrete examples

Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better. Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should.

- start with simple examples
- progress to more comlex examples
- explore examples with empty inputs
- explore examples with invalid input

### Break it Down

Write down the actual steps of the problem and write it down. This forces you to think about the code you'll srite before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details(e.g language syntax) as well.

### Solve or Simplify

Solve the problem and if you can't, solve a simpler problem.
To simplify:

- Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
- Temporarily ignore that difficulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Then incorporate that difficulty back in

### Look Back and Refactor
- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently
- Can you understand it at a glance
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor
- How have other people solved this problem
